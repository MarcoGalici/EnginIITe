**Parameter**;**Datatype**;**Value Range**;**Explanation**
name;string;;name of the static generator
type;string;"| naming conventions:
| *""PV""* - photovoltaic system
| *""WP""* - wind power system
| *""CHP""* - combined heating and power system";type of generator
bus;integer;;index of connected bus
p_mw;float;:math:`\leq` 0;active power of the static generator [MW]
q_mvar;float;;reactive power of the static generator [MVar]
sn_mva;float;:math:`>` 0;rated power ot the static generator [MVA]
scaling;float;:math:`\geq` 0;scaling factor for the active and reactive power
max_p_mw*;float;;Maximum active power [MW]
min_p_mw*;float;;Minimum active power [MW]
max_q_mvar*;float;;Maximum reactive power [MVar]
min_q_mvar*;float;;Minimum reactive power [MVar]
controllable*;bool;;States if sgen is controllable or not, sgen will not be used as a flexibilty if it is not controllable
k*;float;:math:`\geq` 0;Ratio of nominal current to short circuit current
rx*;float;:math:`\geq` 0;R/X ratio for short circuit impedance. Only relevant if type is specified as motor so that sgen is treated as asynchronous motor
in_service;boolean;True / False;specifies if the generator is in service.
element_name**;String;;Name of the resource element that is associated to the model in the platform.
denorm_profile**;float;;Index of connected bus
norm_profile**;String;;Name of the Normalized Profile that is found in the profile file.
external_profile**;boolean;True / False;Specifies if the resource profile must be defined from an external module
