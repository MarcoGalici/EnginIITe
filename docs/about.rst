About EnginIITe
=======================

EnginIITe combines the network calculation program `PandaPower <https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower/tree/master>`_
to develop a simulation platform dedicated to the integrated models on the
mechanisms to acquire system services.

Within this integrated platform, both market-based and power system simulation tools will
coexist, facilitating a coherent sharing of databases. This integration will enable the study of
interconnected problems and scenarios, promoting the comparability of assessment results
as much as possible.

The simulation platform is based on different European project results.
More information about the projects can be found in the folllowing links:

EnginIITe is a joint endeavour of the research group Redes Inteligentes Sostenibles (Redes) from the
Universidad Pontificia Comillas, Escuela Técnica Superior de Ingeniería - ICAI,
Instituto de Investigación Tecnológica IIT.
